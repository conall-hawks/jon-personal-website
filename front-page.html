		Welcome to my personal site. My name is <b>Jon Hawks</b>, I am a software engineer living in the Hartford area of 
		Connecticut. The majority of my work has been with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While much of this <b>work 
		involves web design and technologies</b>, I have also worked with a variety of other languages such as C++, Lua, and 
		Python. My knowledge and experience with these languages are in the order listed.

		Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. Please feel free to take a look around and discover my code, 
		experience, passion, and principles. My <a class="ajax-link" href="resume.html">résumé</a> and 
		<a class="ajax-link" href="contact.html">contact</a> information are also available.<br />

		Below are some priorities I consider when creating software.

<article class="content-box" id="clean-code">
	<h2>Clean Code</h2>
	<p>
		Clean code is readable, methodical, and follows conventions. Clean code can be picked up by fellow developers 
		and understood without having to decipher the logic and labels.

		<b>Clean code:</b>
		<li>Is modular</li>
		<li>Doesn't repeat itself</li>
		<li>Uses conventions/precedents</li>
		<li>Follows best practice</li>
		<li>Flows logically</li>
		<li>Is concise</li>
		<li>Provides scalability</li>
		<li>Has a thoughtful design/layout</li>
		<li>Has good names for functions and variables</li>
		<li>Uses proper spelling, grammar, and indentations</li>
	</ul>

		Is my software safe from attack? What are the possible attack vectors? I find out by auditing my own work using the same 
		tools and methodologies an adversary would use. I always consider security and follow best practice	when writing code.<br />
		<br />
		Reverse engineering and penetration testing have always been tools of particular interest.
