		Welcome to my personal site. My name is <b>Jon Hawks</b>, I am a software engineer living in the Hartford area of 
		Connecticut. The majority of my work has been with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While much of this <b>work 
		involves web design and technologies</b>, I have also worked with a variety of other languages such as C++, Lua, and 
		Python. My knowledge and experience with these languages are in the order listed.
