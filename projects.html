    <h2>Cenari.us</h2>
    <p>
        My primary project. I have recently dubbed it my Cenari Management System (CMS). As the acronym implies, it's
        generally for Content Management. However, Cenari.us is many things:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Programming snippets, guides, and bookmarks.</li>
        <li>Security tutorials and blog.</li>
        <li>Forum</li>
        <li>Imageboard</li>
        <li>Social network</li>
        <li>Personal blog</li>
        <li>Video game guides and blog.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Its primary purpose is to entertain visitors and monetize my knowledge via Google's Adsense. Its secondary
        purpose is as a testing ground for experiments in a production environment. Its tertiary purpose is for my
        own use as a reference on the things I've already learned.<br />

    <h2>Partyline</h2>
    <p>
        Partyline--as the name implies--is a locality-based chatroom. By
        default, users are dropped into a chatroom that is relative to their
        geolocation. However, users may create their own rooms or send private
        messages.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Geolocated chatrooms.</li>
        <li>Private messages.</li>
        <li>Login system with customizable user profiles.</li>
        <li>Temporary "anonymous" user profiles.</li>
        <li>Media uploading.</li>
        <li>File uploading.</li>
        <li>Much, much more!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Initially started as a project to learn Meteor. For a while there I
        think some people were actually using it, but because of a small user
        base it never caught on. I use it now to quickly establish
        communication or transfer files to my friends.
