	<h2>Cenari.us</h2>
	<p>
		My primary project. I have recently dubbed it my Cenari Management System (CMS). As the acronym implies, it's 
		generally for Content Management. However, Cenari.us is many things:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Programming snippets, guides, and bookmarks.</li>
		<li>Security tutorials and blog.</li>
		<li>Forum</li>
		<li>Imageboard</li>
		<li>Social network</li>
		<li>Personal blog</li>
		<li>Video game guides and blog.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Its primary purpose is to entertain visitors and monetize my knowledge via Google's Adsense. Its secondary 
		purpose is as a testing ground for experiments in a production environment. Its tertiary purpose is for my 
		own use as a reference on the things I've already learned.<br />
