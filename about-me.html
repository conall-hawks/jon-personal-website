		Ever since I can remember I have always wanted to be a programmer. Computers--and how they work--have always 
		been of interest to me. I am that type of person who likes to take things apart and put them back together; 
		always building things, always curious.

		I am 26 years old, and originally from Grand Rapids, MI. I cook and eat profuse amounts of Asian cousine. I enjoy 
		listening to blues and industrial music. When reading, I choose technical manuals and documentation over 
		novels.

		Some of my best code was revealed to me during a drive, taking a walk, or other activities. Taking a break from 
		the screen and getting some air can help give me a clear perspective. In addition, revisiting my work can reveal a better way; 
		things I hadn't seen before.<br />
		<br />
		I do my best to keep my activities diverse. However--at the end of the day--I'm usually writing code.
